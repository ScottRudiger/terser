**Bug report or Feature request?**

<!-- Note: sub-optimal but correct code is NOT a bug. -->

**Version (complete output of `terser -V`)**

**Complete CLI command or `minify()` options used**

<!-- Note: if you used the API, you're expected to enable the source-map-support module. -->

**`terser` input**

<!--
    Complete valid ECMAScript code exhibiting the issue with
    `terser` alone - without third party tools or libraries.
    Ideally the input should be as small as possible.
    Code must be in text form - not a screen cap.
    Post a link to a gist if necessary.

    Issues without a reproducible test case will be closed.
